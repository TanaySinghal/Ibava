# IB_Pseudocode

This project is my IB Computer Science internal assessment, meant to help other IB Computer Science students. It is essentially an interpretor that makes it possible to actually write and run IB Pseudocode on your laptop, instead of another programming language like Java. While learning programming and computational thinking, you will also master the IB approved pseudocode syntax. The IDE is within the folder, "App". <br/>

<br/>
Fully functional features: <br/>
- Create/set variables (X = 10) <br/>
- Output (output "Hello world") <br/>
- Basic operations (3+3) <br/>
- Basic comparisons (10 > 9) <br/>
- If statement (and nested if statements) <br/>
- For and while loops (nested allowed) <br/>

<br/>
Limitations: <br/>
- No support yet for AND, OR, and NOT conditions <br/>
- No support yet for multiple operations (can only do one operation per line) <br/>
- No support yet for arrays
- No support yet for user input
- Does not provide very helpful error messages <br/>

<br/>
Bugs: <br/>
- Bug when continue or break is within if statements <br/>
- Bug when loop is within if statements <br/>
